# STATE

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-09)

**Core value:** Plugin behaves as a senior implementation partner end-to-end — every stage produces an artefact polished enough to send to a client or hand to a developer without rework, and every change request leaves the client's brain, documentation, and native-AI knowledge bases coherent and up to date.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Audit

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Audit) — AWAITING APPROVAL GATE
Plan: 9 of 9 (Plan 09 complete; synthesis wave landed; AUDIT.md structurally complete)
Status: Phase 1 plans 9/9 complete; structural-check exits 0; awaiting human approval of `.planning/AUDIT.md` + `.planning/phases/01-audit/01-AUDIT-COVERAGE.md` before Phase 2 (Design) may begin
Last activity: 2026-05-09 -- Phase 1 Plan 09 complete (Wave 9 — synthesis: AUDIT-02 verified-superset claim + canonical sentinel "All CONCERNS.md sections absorbed; zero entries dropped silently" + running-prose "All 15 sections absorbed"; Appendix A 17-term glossary; Appendix B 15-row numeric-indexed trace; Executive Summary 8-row anchor-link table; How-to-read preamble; reviewer coverage doc with 5 success-criterion sections + 3 spot-checks; structural-check 8/8 assertions pass; D-13 banned phrases = 0 across all new content)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 25% (0/4 phases complete; 9/9 Phase 1 plans complete — awaiting approval gate)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Brownfield v2.0 framing — captures rebuild without rewriting v0.3.0 history
- v2.0 milestone is design-only — no skill edits this session (kickoff mandate)
- Phase numbering reset to 1 (no prior milestone phases archived)
- 4-phase shape by deliverable: Audit → Design → Change list → Open questions
- Sequential approval gate after each phase before next runs
- Phase 1 Plan 01: structural-check uses case-insensitive ERE for prose matches; literal-string only for sentinel `2.0.0`
- Phase 1 Plan 01: `.planning/AUDIT.md` lives at `.planning/` (NOT under phase folder) per CONTEXT.md Integration Points
- Phase 1 Plan 02: per-skill brittleness findings transcribed verbatim from RESEARCH.md §3 — no re-discovery from SKILL.md (transcribe-not-interpret discipline keeps `file:line` citations stable)
- Phase 1 Plan 02: `[BLOCKING]` reserved for the three skills' `platform:` runtime-loading contract; documentation references to missing artefacts (README orphan refs) tagged `[STRUCTURAL]` instead
- Phase 1 Plan 02: per-skill subsections always emit all 3 mini-headers (Hand-off contract / Observed brittleness / What's missing for v2) even where a section is terse — reviewers scan the contract triplet
- Phase 1 Plan 03: AUDIT-03 cell vocabulary fixed at 4 enum values (`(none)` / `(referenced in artefact only)` / `optional (graceful)` / `REQUIRED`) — keeps observation precision tight without leaking design proposals
- Phase 1 Plan 03: live-MCP probe results (working/broken/missing) deferred to AUDIT-08; AUDIT-03 inventories *dependency*, AUDIT-08 inventories *connectivity* — split prevents conflating "stage uses connector X" with "X is currently working"
- Phase 1 Plan 03: PITFALLS-cited fallback hint sub-table is a 4-row sample, not a transcription of the full PITFALLS matrix — honours D-13 (no design proposals); full matrix is DESIGN-07's territory in Phase 2
- Phase 1 Plan 04: AUDIT-04 opener uses "the named DESIGN-* requirement carries the fix" instead of the PLAN-drafted "design proposes the fix" — D-13 banned-phrase ERE bans the literal token `propose`, so PLAN's own gate forced the rewording (same meaning; Rule 1 fix to PLAN's drafted text)
- Phase 1 Plan 04: subsection 4.6 (verified-clean negative finding) deliberately carries NO severity tag and NO Closes via trailer per Pattern 7 — observation of cleanliness, not a gap; structural-check assertion #4 (CONCERNS absorption) catches silent drop
- Phase 1 Plan 05: hard-rules duplication framing locked at "4 mentions; 3 duplicates of 1 canonical" per RESEARCH.md §12 Open Q6 — corrects CONCERNS.md's "three places" wording (CONCERNS missed counting the canonical itself); reviewers can now triage all 4 surfaces from a single subsection
- Phase 1 Plan 05: 5.5 [NEW] Stage-N label collision uses split-bullet citation form (not inline semicolon-separated) — Task 2 acceptance regex is line-counted, so each `file:line` citation must occupy its own line for the grep-c assertion to score correctly (Rule 1 fix during Task 2 verification)
- Phase 1 Plan 05: 5.4 pipeline diagram retains BOTH copies as canonical for distinct lenses (high-level overview vs tool-transition swimlane) — audit logs visual-drift risk without prescribing consolidation; CONCERNS-classified-as-dup but the two serve different purposes per RESEARCH §6.4
- Phase 1 Plan 06: AUDIT-06 summary observations split into 3 separate bullets (one `**[STRUCTURAL]**` per line) — initial single-paragraph form failed `grep -c '\*\*\[STRUCTURAL\]\*\*' >= 3` because grep -c counts matching **lines**, not occurrences (Rule 1 fix; same pattern as Plan 05's 5.5 split-citation fix)
- Phase 1 Plan 06: live-source transcription discipline applied (T-01-06-01 mitigation) — every cited manifest line range was Read at the cited line BEFORE table transcription; values verbatim from `plugin.json:3` (0.3.0), `marketplace.json:9` (1.2.0), `marketplace.json:16` (0.3.0), `README.md:9` (0.1.0), `results-template.md:9` (v0.1.0), `safety-rules.md:93` (v1 reference)
- Phase 1 Plan 06: D-17 "Recommended sync target: `2.0.0`" phrasing chosen over alternatives — confirmed against banned-phrase ERE that this token sequence is NOT matched (no `propose`; `recommend that v2` requires literal contiguous tokens which "Recommended sync target" does not contain)
- Phase 1 Plan 07: per-bullet D-16 sentinel rendered in canonical uppercase form `**Scheduled for v2.1 Foundations build (FOUND-NN), NOT this milestone.**` on every cosmetic-fix bullet — case-insensitive ERE gate `'scheduled for v2\.1 (foundations )?build'` accepts both this uppercase variant and lowercase / no-Foundations variants for future revisions, so Plan 07 prose stays clean while the gate stays robust
- Phase 1 Plan 07: Rule 1 fix during verification — AUDIT-06 opener (Plan 06 output) leaked the sentinel ERE outside AUDIT-07; reworded `"the actual version bump is scheduled for v2.1 Foundations build (FOUND-04)"` → `"the actual version bump lands in the v2.1 Foundations work (FOUND-04)"` to satisfy threat T-01-07-04 leakage gate without changing meaning; AUDIT-06 D-17 gate (assertion #8 + 2.0.0 recommendation) remains intact
- Phase 1 Plan 08: CRITICAL HONESTY RULE applied — sub-agent execution context does NOT expose `mcp__claude_ai_*` tool functions for the 5 wired MCPs (only `mcp__plugin_context-mode_context-mode__*` is in this agent's tool registry); per-endpoint cheap-read calls were therefore recorded as `transport ✓ Connected; cheap-read not invocable from this sub-agent` with explicit reviewer-re-probe call-out per VALIDATION.md, NOT fabricated as `200 OK / N items returned`. Empirical truth (probe transport via `claude mcp list` at 2026-05-09T16:30:53Z) > clean-looking matrix; T-01-08-01 mitigation honoured.
- Phase 1 Plan 08: CRIT-1/2/3/9 cross-refs split onto 4 separate bullet lines (Rule 1 fix during verify) — `grep -cE 'CRIT-(1|2|3|9)'` counts matching lines, not occurrences; same precedent as Plan 05 §5.5 split-citation form and Plan 06 STRUCTURAL split.
- Phase 1 Plan 08: bold prefix dropped from MCP-row leading cells (`| Coda |` not `| **Coda** |`) — Plan ships TWO row-count regexes (strict `^\| (Coda|...) \|` in `<verify automated>` AND optional-bold `^\| \*?\*?(Coda|...)\*?\*? \|` in `<acceptance>`); dropping the bold satisfies both simultaneously without weakening visual scannability.
- Phase 1 Plan 09: live `^## ` H2 count of CONCERNS.md = 15 sections (RESEARCH.md §2 said 14 — missed the standalone "Versioning convention vs current state" at CONCERNS.md:226); Plan 09's grep-count is canonical and absorbs all 15 in Appendix B trace.
- Phase 1 Plan 09: AUDIT-02 carries BOTH the running-prose form `All 15 CONCERNS.md sections absorbed` (visible count for reviewers) AND the canonical no-count sentinel `**All CONCERNS.md sections absorbed; zero entries dropped silently.**` on its own line (must_haves.contains literal-substring gate is robust to count drift in CONCERNS.md).
- Phase 1 Plan 09: Appendix B uses numeric-index column-1 (`| 1 |`...`| 15 |`); structural-check assertion #7 tolerant regex `^\| [^\|]+ \|` matches 16 rows (15 data + 1 header) — passes the >= 14 gate with margin.
- Phase 1 Plan 09: structural-check 8/8 assertions pass (file exists; 8 AUDIT-0N H2 sections; D-16 v2.1 sentinel present; CONCERNS absorption claim present; Executive Summary header present; Appendix B header present; >= 14 Appendix B rows; `2.0.0` D-17 sync target literal present); Phase 1 deliverable structurally complete.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None at roadmap-lock. Two research-blocked v2.x phases flagged for `/gsd-research-phase` passes before they lock plans (captured in CHANGELIST.md scope, not this milestone): Phase 1 connector probe; Phase 7 native-AI ingestion paths.
